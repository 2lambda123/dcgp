Differentiable Cartesian Genetic Programming
============================================

Differentiable Cartesian Genetic Programming (dCGP) is a recent development in the field of Genetic Programming
that adds the information about the derivatives of the output nodes (the programs, or expressions encoded) with
respect to the input nodes (the input values) and/or weights. In doing so, it enables a number of new applications
currently the subject of active research.

The evolution of the genetic program can now be supported by using the information on the derivatives, hence enabling
for the equivalent of back-propagation in Neural Networks. The fitness function can be defined in terms of the
derivatives, allowing to go beyond simple regression tasks and, additionally, solve differential equations, learn
differential models, capture conserved quantities in dynamical systems.

Beyond the standard **CGP** we provide two new encodings called **weighted** and **CGPANN**. 
The first one adds weights to the standard CGP nodes connections, while the second one allows to encode and evolve a Deep Neural Network using the CGP basic idea.
